  issues
  unit testing
  mocking classes
  state passing
  chrome messaging
  debugging
  promises
  async await
  webpack
  ui
  bandcamp dom
  bandcamp js bugs

  super basic
  both sides independent state
  no ui
  work on bandcamp side 1st then implement player & chrome classes?
  just play / pause next
  no last action, all current state only

  dom buttons -> array of tracks
  state = index of track
  play = click index button
  pause = click index button
  next = clikc next index
  prev = clikc prev index

  


  blog about issues
    ie run into issues that would be solved by testing: tally and record them so at project end can assess if speing time to setup would have been overall beneficial
      can use pomodoro to track time spend on bugs of different type vs setting up new / old helper libraries / frameworks
